	abstract = {Skin cancer, one of the most dangerous cancers, poses a significant global threat. While early detection can substantially improve survival rates, traditional dermatologists often face challenges in accurate diagnosis, leading to delays in treatment and avoidable fatalities. Deep learning models like CNN and transfer learning have enhanced diagnosis from dermoscopic images, providing precise and timely detection. However, despite the progress made with hybrid models, many existing approaches still face challenges, such as limited generalization across diverse datasets, vulnerability to overfitting, and difficulty in capturing complex patterns. As a result, there is a growing need for more robust and effective hybrid models that integrate multiple architectures and advanced mechanisms to address these challenges. Therefore, this study aims to introduce a novel multi-architecture hybrid deep learning model called "RvXmBlendNet," which combines the strengths of four individual models: ResNet50 (R), VGG19 (v), Xception (X), and MobileNet (m), followed by "BlendNet" to signify their fusion into a unified architecture. The integration of these models is achieved through a synergistic combination of architectures, incorporating self-attention mechanisms using attention layers and adaptive content blocks. This study used the HAM10000 dataset to refine dermoscopic image preprocessing and enhance deep learning model accuracy. Techniques like OpenCV-based hair removal, min–max scaling, and adaptive histogram equalization were employed to improve image quality and feature extraction. A comparative study between the proposed hybrid "RvXmBlendNet" and individual models (CNN, ResNet50, VGG19, Xception, and MobileNet) demonstrated that "RvXmBlendNet" achieved the highest accuracy of 98.26\%, surpassing other models. These results suggest that the system can facilitate earlier interventions, improve patient outcomes, and potentially lower healthcare costs by reducing the need for invasive diagnostic procedures.},

            Agriculture constitutes the foundational pillar of the global economy, engaging a substantial segment of the workforce and making a considerable contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, agricultural productivity faces numerous challenges, including varying climatic conditions, soil types, and limited access to modern farming practices. Developing intelligent agricultural systems becomes imperative to address these challenges and enhance agricultural productivity. Therefore, this paper aims to present a Machine Learning (ML) based crop recommendation system tailored for the farming landscape. The proposed system utilizes historical data on climatic conditions, soil properties, crop yields, and farmer preferences to provide personalized crop recommendations. The goal of this study is to appraise the efficacy of nine distinct ML models—Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Bagging (BG), AdaBoost (AB), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extra Trees (ET) to generate practical recommendations for crop selection. Numerous preprocessing methods are employed to cleanse and normalize the data, thereby ensuring its appropriateness for model training. The ML models are trained using historical data sets, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, soil pH, and nutrient levels, where crop yields are correlated with environmental and agronomic factors. The models undergo fine-tuning through methods such as cross-validation to enhance their performance and ensure robustness. Among those models, Radom Forest has achieved the highest accuracy (99.31\%). The proposed Machine Learning-based crop recommendation system offers a promising approach to addressing the challenges faced by the farmers. By leveraging advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence techniques, the system empowers farmers with timely and personalized recommendations, ultimately leading to improved agricultural productivity, food security, and economic prosperity.},
